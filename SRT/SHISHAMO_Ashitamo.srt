1
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:33,562
월화수목금 계속 일했어

2
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:39,273
아직 모르는 것 투성이라서

3
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:43,956
불안이 나를 덮쳐 버려

4
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:50,042
가끔씩은 기력이 바닥나 버려

5
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:55,961
월화수목금 계속 일했어

6
00:00:55,963 --> 00:01:01,796
기력이 바닥나도 매일 열심히 하는 수밖에 없잖아

7
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:07,842
그래도 금요일이 지나면 괜찮아

8
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:13,107
주말에는 나의 히어로 만나러 가거든

9
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:19,125
안 돼 더이상은 안 돼 일어 설 수 없어

10
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:24,958
그런 자신을 바꾸고 싶어 오늘도 가는 거야

11
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:31,475
언제나 좋은 일만 있는 건 아니야

12
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:36,608
고통스러워서 울고 싶은 때도 있어

13
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:39,591
그럴 때는 항상

14
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:47,507
누구보다 빨리 일어 서는 히어로를 만나고 싶어서

15
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:53,023
아프지만 달렸어 괴롭지만 달렸어

16
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:58,239
보답받을 수 있을 지는 모르지만

17
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,392
일단 아직 나는 부러지지 않아

18
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,874
히어로에 나를 겹쳐서

19
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:10,932
내일도

20
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:16,555
All days of the week, I go to school

21
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:27,334
Keeping up with what my friends talk about is actually quite tough for me

22
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:33,483
What I really like is not yesterday’s TV show

23
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:39,179
All days of the week, I go to school

24
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:45,112
I actually don’t even know Shibuya nor Harajuku

25
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:51,083
But once Friday ends it’ll all be fine

26
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:56,382
I will go and meet my hero on the weekend

27
00:02:57,589 --> 00:03:02,376
No, there is no way, I can’t even wipe my tears

28
00:03:02,376 --> 00:03:08,425
I want to change myself, so I will go today

29
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:19,975
I may be laughed by other people for getting anxious over a tiny thing

30
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:25,251
Without even smiling, he will show me

31
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:30,900
My hero will teach me, how to run

32
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:36,262
Although it’s painful and it hurts, I still ran

33
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:41,251
I don’t know if tomorrow will be any different

34
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:46,727
But for now, I will not be beaten

35
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:51,427
With my hero and myself

36
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:55,158
Even tomorrow

37
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:19,183
It doesn't always work out

38
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:24,315
There are tough times that make you want to cry

39
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:26,898
When that happens

40
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:34,892
I just want to meet the hero that rises up before anyone

41
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,596
Although it’s painful and it hurts, I still ran

42
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:45,762
I don’t know if I will be rewarded

43
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:51,108
But for now, I will not be beaten

44
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:55,267
With my hero and myself

45
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:56,793
Even tomorrow

46
00:04:56,893 --> 00:05:02,149
Work, relationships, and education

47
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:07,115
None of these can be omitted

48
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:12,481
Just think it’s for your future

49
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:17,584
Crying is not a bad thing

50
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:23,564
Encourage yourself from yesterday

51
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:28,630
And just run earnestly today

52
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:34,079
He will teach me how to run again

53
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,412
With my hero and myself

54
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:45,184
Even tomorrow
